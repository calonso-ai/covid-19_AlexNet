# COVID-19 detection with AlexNet

(Results and analysis in Wiki)

One of the applications of AI is the processing of medical images. In particular, the use of radiographs for rapid and non-invasive detection of Covid-19 can be extremely helpful in assisting and expediting the task of medical personnel. In this project we will develop a Covid-19 Deep Learning detector in radiographs based on AlexNet model. To do this, we will use the images from the "Covid-chestxray-dataset" database [1], generated by researchers from the Mila research group and the University of Montreal[2]. We will also use radiographic images of healthy and bacterial pneumonia patients drawn from the Kaggle "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" competition [3]. 

In total, we have a quantity of 426 images, divided into training set (339 images), validation set (42 images) and test set (45 images). Partitions are given in ".txt" lists, in which each image is assigned a label:

0) Healthy
1) Covid-19
2) Pneumonia

The objective is to develop a system based on AlexNet capable of correctly classifying images in these 3 categories. In addition, we´ll compare AlexNet model with a simple baseline model.
